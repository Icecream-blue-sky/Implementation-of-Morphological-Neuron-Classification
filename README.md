# Implementation-of-Morphological-Neuron-Classification
This is the implementation of paper 《[Morphological Neuron Classification Based on Dendritic Tree Hierarchy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-018-9388-7)》.<br>
All code is in "classification" directory.<br>
And the code is based on btmorph(refrence [1]).But I have changed some code to make it suitable for big neruon data processing.<br>
What's more, the neuron morphological features are measured by L-Measure software.
